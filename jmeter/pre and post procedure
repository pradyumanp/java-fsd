#1) Regular Expression Extractor
A regular expression extractor is used to get the information from the response of the server. It uses Perl-type Regular expression for extracting the information i.e. values. This processor will run after each sampler request is executed.

How it works:

Sampler Request->Apply Regular expression extractor-> Information/Value extraction-> Template String generation ->Storage of extracted value/Information in a specific variable name

Create a Test Plan
Add Thread Group
Add Sampler “HTTP Request”
Add the Processor “Regular expression extractor”
Apply To: “Apply to” has 4 options.

Main Sample and Sub Samples: It applies to both main samples and Sub Samples.
Main Samples only: It gets applied to the main samples only.
Sub Samples only: It gets applied to Sub Samples only.
JMeter Variable: The extraction is applied to the named variable only.
Field To Check: Field to check has a number of options. All the field names are self-explanatory as their name suggests.

The body represents the body of the response i.e. content excluding headers.
Body (Unescaped): The body of the response which has all the HTML escape codes replaced.
Body as a Document – From the number of documents data is extracted.
The name of the created variable will have the extracted text saved.
The regular expression will match the pattern against the text to be extracted.’.+?’ represents a single instance of the text placed by the tags.
Template: Template is used to create a String for the extracted values match.
$1$ represents group 1
Match No (0 for Random): To get which one to select as a variable.

0 indicates a random value from the found results.
Nth number indicates the nth number from the found results.
Any negative number – indicates that all the data should be extracted.
Default Value: The reference value is set to the default value in case the Regular expression does not match.
